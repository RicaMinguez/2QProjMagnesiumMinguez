            Water pollution hurts all life forms that need water to drink – from humans to elephants to grass. Sometimes we can see water pollution – think of foam, formed from the build-up of toxic chemical waste, flowing down rivers, and oil spills out at sea. Sometimes, we cannot see it – think of tiny microplastics.

            How to Help Limit Water Pollution
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Use reusable items (metal straws, reusable water bottles, washable metal/plastic utensils, etc.) instead of single-use items</li>
                <li>Buy merchandise that uses minimal plastic packaging</li>
                <li>Support groups that carry out beach clean-ups and other similar efforts. You could donate to them, help them get more publicity, or even join them in clean-up efforts when it is safe to do so.</li>
                <li>If you can, avoid buying products from companies that have a recent history of irresponsibly causing water pollution.</li>
            </ul>
